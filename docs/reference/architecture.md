# Architecture

Nemo Clawd has two main components: a TypeScript plugin that integrates with the Nemo Clawd CLI, and a Python blueprint that orchestrates OpenShell resources.

## Nemo Clawd Plugin

The plugin is a thin TypeScript package that registers commands under `nemoclawd`.
It runs in-process with the Nemo Clawd gateway and handles user-facing CLI interactions.

## Nemo Clawd Blueprint

The blueprint is a versioned Python artifact with its own release stream.
The plugin resolves, verifies, and executes the blueprint as a subprocess.
The blueprint drives all interactions with the OpenShell CLI.

```text
nemoclawd-blueprint/
├── blueprint.yaml                  Manifest — version, profiles, compatibility
├── orchestrator/
│   └── runner.py                   CLI runner — plan / apply / status
├── policies/
│   └── nemoclawd-sandbox.yaml       Strict baseline network + filesystem policy
```

### Blueprint Lifecycle

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[resolve] --> B[verify digest]
    B --> C[plan]
    C --> D[apply]
    D --> E[status]
```

1. Resolve. The plugin locates the blueprint artifact and checks the version against `min_openshell_version` and `min_nemoclawd_version` constraints in `blueprint.yaml`.
2. Verify. The plugin checks the artifact digest against the expected value.
3. Plan. The runner determines what OpenShell resources to create or update, such as the gateway, providers, sandbox, inference route, and policy.
4. Apply. The runner executes the plan by calling `openshell` CLI commands.
5. Status. The runner reports current state.

## Sandbox Environment

The sandbox runs the
[`ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/nemo clawd`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community)
container image. Inside the sandbox:

- Nemo Clawd runs with the Nemo Clawd plugin pre-installed.
- Inference calls are routed through OpenShell to the configured provider.
- Network egress is restricted by the baseline policy in `nemoclawd-sandbox.yaml`.
- Filesystem access is confined to `/sandbox` and `/tmp` for read-write access, with system paths read-only.

## Inference Routing

Inference requests from the agent never leave the sandbox directly.
OpenShell intercepts them and routes to the configured provider:

```text
Agent (sandbox)  ──▶  OpenShell gateway  ──▶  NVIDIA cloud (build.nvidia.com)
```

Refer to [Inference Profiles](../reference/inference-profiles.md) for provider configuration details.
