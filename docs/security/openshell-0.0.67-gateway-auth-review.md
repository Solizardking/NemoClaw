# OpenShell 0.0.67 Gateway Auth Review

Review date: 2026-06-24

Scope: NemoClaw Docker-driver gateway config generated for OpenShell `0.0.67`.

## Source-of-Truth Boundaries

- OpenShell gateway auth source contract: invalid state is an OpenShell `0.0.67` Docker-driver gateway launched from NemoClaw without the upstream config-file auth policy, local mTLS bundle, sandbox JWT bundle, or Docker bridge callback route that OpenShell expects. Source boundary is upstream OpenShell config/auth/listener/Docker-driver behavior; NemoClaw only generates config, local TLS/JWT material, bind policy, and launch env. Regression coverage is the live `openshell-gateway-auth-source-contract` scenario plus local config/env/launch tests. Remove the NemoClaw-local compatibility notes when OpenShell exposes a stable SDK/config contract that makes this generated config surface unnecessary.
- Docker-hosted gateway compatibility container: invalid state is a host with older glibc than the downloaded `openshell-gateway` binary, where the gateway must run in a compatibility container but still behave like the host-side Docker-driver gateway. Source boundary is OpenShell Docker-driver bridge discovery plus Docker API access. NemoClaw uses `--network host` so OpenShell can bind the same Docker bridge callback addresses, mounts the Docker socket read/write so the gateway can drive the Docker compute driver, keeps the main listener on `127.0.0.1`, and publishes no additional container ports. Rootless Docker/Podman remain outside the accepted path for this shim until the OpenShell Docker driver publishes a supported rootless compatibility contract.
- Markerless sandbox gateway recovery output: invalid state is newer OpenShell sandbox exec/relaunch output that starts the gateway launcher but omits NemoClaw's legacy `GATEWAY_PID=` or `ALREADY_RUNNING` markers. Source boundary is OpenShell exec/recovery output format; NemoClaw treats the text as "may have started" only and still requires a healthy gateway probe. Regression coverage lives in `test/cli/connect-recovery-markerless.test.ts`. Remove the markerless heuristic when OpenShell provides a stable machine-readable recovery marker.
- Sessions admin gateway RPC helper: invalid state is a host CLI session reset/delete action that needs OpenClaw backend/operator scope while preserving gateway token, loopback, and auto-pair boundaries. Source boundary is OpenClaw's gateway-runtime API; NemoClaw's helper is limited to `sessions.reset` and `sessions.delete`. Regression coverage lives in `src/lib/actions/sandbox/sessions/gateway-rpc-call.test.ts`. Add new methods only with a caller, allowlist entry, and negative test.

## Acceptance Mapping

Issue #5591 is the dependency-update umbrella. Its literal proposed-design clauses map across the split dependency PRs:

- `Latest stable version of Hermes`: handled by PR #5594 (`dep/hermes-v2026.6.19`), not by this OpenShell PR.
- `Latest version of OpenShell`: this PR pins and validates OpenShell `0.0.67`.
- `Latest stable version of OpenClaw`: handled by PR #5595 (`dep/openclaw-2026.6.9`), not by this OpenShell PR.

Issue #2478 is not an acceptance target for this OpenShell version-pin PR. Its crash-loop clauses include "Every time it boots, it crashes on the same line" and "`connect` doesn't auto-recover" because `@homebridge/ciao` calls `os.networkInterfaces()` under sandbox netlink restrictions. The source fix remains the existing guard-chain/preload work validated by `test/e2e-scenario/live/issue-2478-crash-loop-recovery.test.ts`. This PR only updates markerless recovery wrapper behavior: newer OpenShell relaunch output can be accepted after, and only after, the gateway health probe succeeds.

## Source Review

Reviewed upstream source at `NVIDIA/OpenShell@v0.0.67` (`ce788b50f9b1f977a4327e4484c5b663013dd9a5`):

- `crates/openshell-core/src/config.rs`: `GatewayAuthConfig.allow_unauthenticated_users` is documented as an unsafe local-development escape hatch for user/CLI calls; sandbox supervisor calls still use gateway-minted sandbox JWTs.
- `crates/openshell-server/src/config_file.rs`: OpenShell loads the gateway tables from config files through `openshell_server::config_file::load()`.
- `crates/openshell-server/src/lib.rs`: when `gateway_jwt` is configured, OpenShell reads the configured signing key, public key, and kid, then installs both `SandboxJwtIssuer` and `SandboxJwtAuthenticator`.
- `crates/openshell-server/src/multiplex.rs`: mTLS user authentication promotes a verified client certificate into a user principal when `[openshell.gateway.mtls_auth] enabled = true`; when `allow_unauthenticated_users` is false, missing auth is rejected.
- `crates/openshell-server/src/multiplex.rs`: user principals are rejected from sandbox-only methods with `permission_denied`, while sandbox principals are checked against the sandbox method allowlist.
- `crates/openshell-server/src/lib.rs`: the server binds the configured main listener plus compute-driver `gateway_bind_addresses`, skipping only driver addresses already covered by a wildcard listener.
- `crates/openshell-driver-docker/src/lib.rs`: Docker-driver sandboxes see loopback and arbitrary hostnames rewritten to `host.openshell.internal:<gateway-port>`, and native Linux Docker gets a bridge-gateway bind address such as `<docker-bridge-gateway-ip>:<gateway-port>`.
- `crates/openshell-server/src/auth/sandbox_jwt.rs`: `SandboxJwtAuthenticator` validates Ed25519/EdDSA sandbox JWTs, requires the configured `kid`, `iss`, `aud`, and `sub`, and rejects expired tokens while allowing non-matching `kid` values to fall through to other authenticators.

## NemoClaw Boundary

NemoClaw generates an OpenShell gateway config with `gateway_jwt`, local TLS, mTLS user authentication, and `allow_unauthenticated_users = false`. Host-side OpenShell CLI user calls use local mTLS; sandbox callbacks use mTLS plus the OpenShell gateway JWT. In this PR, host-side OpenShell CLI user calls use local mTLS instead of the unsafe unauthenticated local-user fallback.

The generated config sets `[openshell.gateway.tls]` with the NemoClaw-owned local server certificate, requires client certificates, enables `[openshell.gateway.mtls_auth]`, and provides Docker `guest_tls_ca`, `guest_tls_cert`, and `guest_tls_key` entries so supervisor-to-gateway callbacks use the same local CA. It also scrubs inherited `OPENSHELL_DISABLE_GATEWAY_AUTH=true` from host and compatibility-container launches.

The Docker-hosted compatibility gateway keeps the main OpenShell listener on `127.0.0.1`. Sandbox callback reachability is preserved by OpenShell's Docker driver: it rewrites the sandbox-facing endpoint to `host.openshell.internal:<gateway-port>` and the OpenShell server adds the computed Docker bridge listener when that route is needed. `NEMOCLAW_OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_COMPAT_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` is rejected so the main listener is not widened. The compatibility container does not publish Docker ports; it uses host networking only for parity with the host gateway's Docker bridge listener calculation.

Package-managed Docker-driver gateways also reject `NEMOCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` while the 0.0.67 Docker-driver config is active. Use the dashboard bind setting for remote dashboard exposure instead of widening the OpenShell gateway surface.

## Upstream Contract Coverage

`test/e2e-scenario/live/openshell-gateway-auth-source-contract.test.ts` is the live/source-contract scenario for this PR. It uses OpenShell 0.0.67 plus NemoClaw-generated `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_CONFIG` and verifies:

- no-token Docker sandbox-origin access to a user-callable gateway API is rejected or unreachable;
- valid sandbox JWT access from Docker origin to an allowlisted sandbox method reaches OpenShell auth over `host.openshell.internal` with the generated guest mTLS material, and a token minted for one sandbox is rejected when it requests another sandbox config;
- inherited `OPENSHELL_DISABLE_GATEWAY_AUTH=true` remains scrubbed from the launch env.

Local run against `NVIDIA/OpenShell@v0.0.67`:

- `cargo test -p openshell-server sandbox_jwt -- --nocapture`: passed 7 sandbox JWT tests, including `mint_and_validate_round_trip`, `token_signed_by_other_key_is_rejected`, `malformed_token_is_rejected`, and `expired_token_is_rejected`.
- `cargo test -p openshell-server mtls_auth -- --nocapture`: passed mTLS user principal tests, including the missing-peer-identity rejection.
- `cargo test -p openshell-server sandbox_principal_can_call_allowlisted_method -- --nocapture`: passed.
- `cargo test -p openshell-server user_principal_is_denied_on_sandbox_only_methods -- --nocapture`: passed.
- `cargo test -p openshell-server gateway_listener_addresses -- --nocapture`: passed `gateway_listener_addresses_include_driver_address_on_distinct_ip` and `gateway_listener_addresses_skip_driver_address_covered_by_wildcard`.
- `cargo test -p openshell-driver-docker container_visible_endpoint_rewrites_loopback_hosts -- --nocapture`: passed.
- `cargo test -p openshell-driver-docker docker_gateway_route_uses_bridge_gateway_for_linux_docker -- --nocapture`: passed.
